## Overview
- The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a connected graph that connects all the vertices together
- As the name suggests, this subset has a minimum weight/length, depending on if the original graph is weighted
- The MST has no cycles and is undirected
- There are two commonly used algorithms for finding the MST

## Kruskal's Algorithm
## Prim's Algorithm
